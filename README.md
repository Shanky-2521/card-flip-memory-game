# Memory Maestro: An FPGA-Powered Card Flipping Adventure 

## Welcome to the Game!

Imagine a classic memory game, but with a twist - it's running on a custom hardware platform that brings digital magic to life! This project transforms a simple card-flipping game into a high-performance embedded system adventure.

### What Makes This Special? 

- **VGA Visual Feast**: A crisp 4x4 grid that brings your memory challenge to life
- **Responsive Controls**: Navigate and flip cards with precision GPIO switches
- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Instant feedback and lightning-fast game mechanics
- **Smart Timing**: Intelligent card flip delays that keep you on your toes
- **Event Logging**: Optional UART output to track your gaming journey

### Under the Hood 

We're powering this game with some serious tech:
- **Brain**: ARM Cortex-M0 Processor
- **Nervous System**: AHB-Lite Bus Architecture
- **Memory**: Blazing-fast On-chip BRAM
- **Display**: Crystal-clear VGA Output
- **Controls**: Responsive GPIO Switches

## Project Anatomy ðŸ—‚

- `docs/`: Where the story of our project lives
- `src/rtl/`: The hardware description (our game's DNA)
- `src/testbench/`: Rigorous testing ground
- `src/software/`: Embedded software magic
- `constraints/`: FPGA connection blueprints
- `scripts/`: Build and deployment wizardry

## Let's Get Started! 

### What You'll Need
- Xilinx Vivado Design Suite (2019.1 or newer)
- Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA Board
- USB Programming Cable
- A spirit of adventure! 

### Setup in 2 Easy Steps

1. Grab the Code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/card-flip-memory-game.git
   cd card-flip-memory-game
   ```

2. Bring It to Life:
   ```bash
   vivado -mode batch -source scripts/vivado_build.tcl
   ```

### Running Simulations
To run testbenches, use the following Vivado commands:
```bash
# VGA Display Testbench
xvlog src/testbench/vga_display_tb.v
xelab vga_display_tb
xsim vga_display_tb

# Game Logic Testbench
xvlog src/testbench/game_logic_tb.v
xelab game_logic_tb
xsim game_logic_tb

# UART Logger Testbench
xvlog src/testbench/uart_logger_tb.v
xelab uart_logger_tb
xsim uart_logger_tb
```

### UART Logging
The game includes an optional UART logging module that transmits game events:
- Card flipped events
- Card match events
- Game completion events (with total moves)

To view UART logs:
1. Connect a USB-to-UART converter to the UART TX pin
2. Use a terminal program (e.g., PuTTY, screen) with:
   - Baud Rate: 115200
   - Data Bits: 8
   - Stop Bits: 1
   - Parity: None

### Hardware Connections

- `RIGHT_BTN`: Navigate cursor right
- `SELECT_BTN`: Select/Flip card

#### VGA Output
- `HSYNC`: Horizontal sync
- `VSYNC`: Vertical sync
- `RED[3:0]`: Red color channel
- `GREEN[3:0]`: Green color channel

#### 7-Segment Display
- `SEG_DISPLAY[6:0]`: Segment lines
- `SEG_SELECT[3:0]`: Digit selection

#### UART

### Bitstream Generation
The build script automatically generates a bitstream in the `build/` directory.

### Programming the FPGA
1. Open Vivado Hardware Manager
2. Connect your FPGA board
3. Open the generated bitstream
4. Program the device
